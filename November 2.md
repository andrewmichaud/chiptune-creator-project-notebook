# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

This week, I have chosen my project focus.  I still need to finalize the plan and start actually working on my project.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue is what host language I should use.  Once I've done that, I can start work on finalizing the syntax and working on the sound generation backend.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

How does the scope of this project sound?  Does it seem interesting?  Does this seem like a good project?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Very little.  I spent an hour or so today coming up with the idea and writing up the description and plan.
